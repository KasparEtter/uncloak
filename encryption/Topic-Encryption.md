# Topic: Encryption
## Intro
**Encryption** and decryption is process of hiding and unhiding information. Cryptographers call the original *message* [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext), and the encrypted message [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext), [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) being the historical word for a [[Topic-Symmetric Encryption|symmetric encryption algorithm]]. 

Encryption can be broadly categorized into two categories: symmetric encryption and [[Topic-Asymmetric Encryption|asymmetric encryption]] (public key encryption). Symmetric encryption algorithms require both the encrypter and decrypter to have access to the same information, a shared key. In asymmetric key cryptography, the receiving decrypter holds a secret key (known only to the decrypter), while the encrypter uses the receiving party's public key (which may be published online, or distributed in any way). 

Symmetric key encryption is at least as old as Julius Caesar, who was said to use a [[rotation cipher|Algorithm-Rotation Cipher]], termed the Caesar Cipher, to conceal his messages from enemy soldiers[^1].
