# Uncloak: A Community Maintained Cryptography Resource (WIP)
The site is hosted https://publish.obsidian.md/uncloak/.

Contributions are invited. 
- Discuss the site on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h) 
- Contribute by opening an issue or pull request.
- An explanation of the [node categorization system](https://hackmd.io/QY_U3iuuSG2l_PcsZKd9Uw)

## On site maintenance:
Note that the site is limited to 4GB of image content. Convert all images to SVG before including them in files.
Also note that changes to this git repository do not automatically push to the site. This has to be done manually, until we get around to automating it.
