# Uncloak: A Community Maintained Cryptography Resource (WIP)
Welcome to Uncloak, an experiment in building a community-maintained knowledge wiki-like thing, aiming to increase the accessibility of cryptography for developers, researchers, and everyone else. 

Our approach to knowledge organization attempts to incorporate basic ideas about how knowledge is constructed, representing content as nodes in a dependency graph. We believe this approach may help to clarify how to approach cryptography as a field for readers of all levels, while aiming to maintain a high standard for what information is relevant for different audiences.

The site will initially focus on generating content directed at cryptography learners and developers in cryptography engineering and zero knowledge, as we see these fields as generally lacking in resources.

Work on site content began in November 2022; the site graph is sparse at the moment, but growing rapidly. If you see an area you might like to improve, we appreciate contributions to the site. Currently the best way to do so is by opening a pull request on our [Github](https://github.com/thor314/uncloak).  If you're reading this from Github, the site is hosted at https://uncloak.org. Though the site is hosted via Obsidian Publish, you don't need to use Obsidian to contribute to the site; all files are pure Markdown. We're currently working on resources for site contributors. An early element of this is our [node categorization system](https://hackmd.io/QY_U3iuuSG2l_PcsZKd9Uw).

Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h) is a good place to ask questions and connect with other contributors. We also have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uncloakcrypto) account for site-related announcements. Questions for the site maintainer should be directed at thorck a-squiggle pm dot me.

The Obsidian-Publish mobile site is unfortunately unable to display the desktop-only interactive graph or search features.

## On site maintenance:
Note that the site is limited to 4GB of image content. Convert all images to SVG before including them in files.
Also note that changes to this git repository do not automatically push to the site. This has to be done manually, until we get around to automating it.
