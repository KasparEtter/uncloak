# Uncloak: A Community Maintained Cryptography Resource
Welcome to Uncloak, a community-maintained knowledge wiki experiment, aiming to increase the accessibility of cryptography for developers, researchers, and everyone else. 

Our approach to knowledge organization attempts to incorporate basic ideas about how knowledge is constructed, representing content as nodes in a graph. We believe this approach may help to clarify how to approach cryptography as a field for readers of all levels, while aiming to maintain a high standard for what information is relevant for different audiences.

The site will initially focus on generating content directed at cryptography learners and developers in cryptography engineering and zero knowledge, as we see these fields as most lacking in resources.

Work on site content began in November 2022; the site graph is sparse at the moment, but growing. If you see an area you might like to improve, we appreciate contributions to the site. Currently the best way to do so is by opening an issue or pull request on our [Github](https://github.com/thor314/uncloak).  If you're reading this from Github, the site is hosted at https://uncloak.org. Though the site is hosted via Obsidian Publish, you don't need to use Obsidian to contribute to the site; all files are pure Markdown. We're currently working on resources for site contributors. 

Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TYwr4pMS2h) is a good place to ask questions and connect with other contributors. We also have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uncloakcrypto) account for site-related announcements. Questions for the site maintainer should be directed at thorck a-squiggle pm dot me.

The Obsidian-Publish mobile site is unfortunately unable to display the desktop-only interactive graph or search features.

## Tips for making best use of the site
(todo) 

## Contributor Guide
For more on contributing, see [[Topic-Meta]] (todo).

### On site maintenance:
Note that the site is limited to 4GB of image content. Prefer using markdown tools like [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io) to including images where possible. Convert all images to SVG before including them in files. Changes to this git repository do not automatically push to the site. This has to be done manually, until we get around to automating it.

## How to give
The site would not be possible without the support of grants and donations. The site maintainer works full time on improving site content, alongside several volunteer contributors.

If you would like to support the continued growth of the site, consider donating. Some addresses are managed through Kraken, which may include a minimum deposit. 

We also participate in [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/9478/uncloak-cryptography) rounds. The next round is anticipated to start in late November; we will make an announcement on the [Uncloak Twitter](https://twitter.com/uncloakcrypto) when the round is beginning.
